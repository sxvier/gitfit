GitFit

A website for all of your workout and meal prep needs.

This Website was buit with your goals in mind.
GitFit allows you to save your workouts and meal plans.

Being able to save your workouts allows you to always refer back to them and if you want to improve a certain workout you can see how many reps you did and try to beat that number. It is always about improvement.
 Saving your meals allows you too see what you ate a certain day or with a certain workout and if it felt right you can create that same workout plan along with that meal to maximize your output.

 This Project uses express.js for the backend of the application. Using express generator to create routes for the login, and register page, and for the user routes.

 Sequelize and postgreSQL was used for the databse and the meals workouts and users are stored in the database.

 Create react app was used for the front end in order to incorporte react. I used react router to route all of the different pages.

 React bootstrap and css was used to style the pages with containers, forms, buttons and etc. 

 Features to come in the future are a calorie counter and a run recorder with google maps apit incorporated.
